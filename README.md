## Architecture Highlights

- **Greedy Debt Settlement Algorithm** — Minimizes the number of transactions required to settle all debts within a group
- **Offline-first PWA** — Service worker pre-caches all assets including Google Fonts; the app works with no internet connection after first load
- **No Backend Required** — All data lives in `localStorage`. Zero server costs, zero privacy concerns
- **i18n Auto-detection** — Automatically selects language based on `navigator.language` on first launch
